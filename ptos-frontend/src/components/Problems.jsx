        <p>
          Most traders lose not because of bad entries, but because they don’t
          understand their own performance.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>No clear view of what strategies actually work</li>
          <li>Trades scattered across exchanges</li>
          <li>Manual journaling that gets abandoned</li>
          <li>No structured review process</li>
